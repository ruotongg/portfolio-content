                <p>Animes are popular among a diversity of people. Here, I focus on the accessibility aspects of Cowboy Bebop.</p>

                <h2>Disabled Characters</h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why I chose this anime as the final project topic is that almost all of the main characters have disabilities, which is really rare not only in animes but also in sci-fi. <br> Spike lost his natural eye, and his right eye was surgically replaced by a fully-functioning cybernetic eye. <br>Jet's original limb was lost when he was ambushed by a syndicate assassin and his crooked cop partner. His left arm is a synthetic, robotic limb that seems to heighten his strength. <br> Faye lost memories of her past life after being frozen in suspended animation until 2068.<br>Ed is suspected to have autism or ADHD.</p>

                <p>Here is a full list of animes featuring main characters with disabilities: <a href="https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/disability">Disability anime</a>.</p>
